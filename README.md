# Build Destination of the Hello World Collection

This is where the Hello World Collection, http://helloworldcollection.de, is hosted.

The Collection is built from source files at https://github.com/wolframroesler/helloworld. The destination repository only receives automated pushes from the source build script.

Don't try to manually modify anything in the destination repository, and please don't submit pull requests. To contribute to the Collection, please e-mail me at info@helloworldcollection.de.
